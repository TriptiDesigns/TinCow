# TinCow
TinCow is a clone of Tinder, but for Cows. This project uses HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5 to create a seamless user experience. Developed as a challenge for my Web Development Course, TinCow showcases my skills in front-end development and responsive design. The platform is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience across all devices.
